Hello! I'm Aadit Agrawal, a computers enthusiast. I love tinkering with computers, whether it be on a hardware or a software level. 

I am a homelabber, and a privacy enthusiast, and love to make things that solve problems. This blog, therefore, is a way to document the small projects and the technical journey of developing them. 

Hope you enjoy reading it all!
